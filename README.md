This project is a catalogue of code examples illustrating how one can integrate systems with DHIS2. Each code example is accompanied with a README file that briefly describes the example and instructions how to run it.

Different technologies such as Apache Camel are used to demonstrate the integrations though these examples are meant to offer guidance and not serve as best practices. It should be highlighted that the code is not intended for production use so the necessary code reviews should be performed prior to running it on a production environment.

The catalogued examples include:

* [DHIS2 organisation units, option sets, and tracked entities to their FHIR counterparts](dhis2-to-fhir-bundle/README.md)
* [DHIS2 organisation units to its FHIR counterpart using DataSonnet for mapping the resources](dhis2-to-fhir-bundle-datasonnet/README.md)
* [Data value set synchronisation between two DHIS2 instances using the DHIS2 Java SDK](data-value-set-sync-dhis2-java-sdk/README.md)
* [DHIS2 tracked entities to FHIR questionnaire responses](fhir-esavi-paho/README.md)
* [Automating DHIS2 integration testing](integration-test/README.md)
